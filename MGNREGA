# MGNREGA â€“ Our Voice, Our Rights

This is my small Django project made for the Bharat Digital Fellowship task.  
It shows how each district is performing in the MGNREGA scheme using open data from the Government of India.

# Purpose
Many rural people cannot easily access or understand MGNREGA data online.  
So, I made a simple site where they can just choose their district and see basic details like:
- Person days generated  
- Households worked  
- Total wages paid  

# How it works
The project collects data from the official API (data.gov.in) and stores it in a local file (`data.json`)  
so the website still works even if the API goes down.

# tech used
- Python  
- Django Framework  
- HTML and a bit of CSS  


# How to run
1. Install Django and Requests
